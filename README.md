# AdvancedDeepLearning
DL with Tensorflow 2.4 and Keras

This is code following *Deep Learning With Tensorflow 2 and Keras* by *Packt* 

All of the code is on google colab, a resource which allows the free access of GPUS and TPUS on the cloud 

Most of the code is expirimental as I try experiments the book suggests

This repository includes:
  CNNs
  Advanced CNNs
  Regression
  Tensorflow Basics
  RNNs and LSTMs
  GANs
  Reenforcement Learing
  Autoencoders and VAEs
