# AdvancedDeepLearning
DL with Tensorflow 2.4 and Keras

This is code following *Deep Learning With Tensorflow 2 and Keras* by *Packt* 

All of the code is on google colab, a resource which allows the free access of GPUS and TPUS on the cloud 

Most of the code is expirimental as I try experiments the book suggests

This repository includes:
  CNN \n
  Advanced CNNs \n
  Regression \n
  Tensorflow Basics \n
  RNNs and LSTMs \n
  GANs \n
  Reenforcement Learing \n
  Autoencoders and VAEs \n
  
 __Important Note*__ Some of the code in this repository is very similar to the repository of the book. I have written all of this code and now understand this subject to the fullest. It is not me copy-pasting the code from their repository, but rather me coding directly from the book, line by line. Some code are just some of my expirements the book may have not gone over.
